### Operating System:
- [What is Operating System (OS)? Definition, Types, and Functions](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/what-is-operating-system/)</br>This site explains what is an operating system, what do they do, types of operating systems, and more. I think it's quite good for beginners to get into operating system.

### Linux:
- [What is Linux?](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux/)</br>This video explains linux in less than three minutes. It's good if you are busy.

### Bash:
- [Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4)</br>Video about Bash scripting and Bash commands. As the title says, it's pretty easy to understand for beginners

### Vi:
- [Vi Editor Cheat sheet](https://www.cse.scu.edu/~yfang/coen11/vi-CheatSheet.pdf)</br>PDF file that contains commands for Vi editor. I think it's really simple and quite comprehensive.

### Markdown:
- [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)</br>Documentations for markdown file from GitHub. Very helpful since we are going to edit a lot of markdown file in this course.
